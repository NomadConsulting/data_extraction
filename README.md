# Data Extraction Repository

This repository contains scripts and data related to extracting and analyzing geospatial data using QGIS,Google Earth Engine, Python geemap package.

## Overview

The repository is structured to facilitate the extraction and analysis of geospatial data using QGIS software. It includes scripts and instructions for various tasks related to data extraction, processing, and visualization.

## Repository Contents

- **QGIS Projects**: Contains QGIS project files (`*.qgs`) for different datasets and analyses.
- **Scripts**: Includes Python scripts and QGIS processing scripts used for data extraction and analysis.
- **Data**: Data files and datasets used in the QGIS projects.
- **Documentation**: Additional documentation related to the data, scripts, and project workflows.

## Storing a QGIS Project on GitHub

To store a QGIS project on GitHub, follow these steps:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub named `data_extraction`.

2. **Prepare Your QGIS Project**:
   - Open your QGIS project and ensure it is organized with all necessary data layers, styles, and configurations.

3. **Save the Project File Locally**:
   - Save your QGIS project file (`*.qgs`) locally on your computer.

4. **Initialize a Local Git Repository**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where your QGIS project file is stored.
   - Initialize a Git repository:
     ```
     git init
     ```

5. **Add QGIS Project and Data Files**:
   - Add your QGIS project file (`*.qgs`) and any associated data files or folders to the Git repository:
     ```
     git add .
     ```

6. **Commit Changes**:
   - Commit the changes to your local Git repository with a meaningful commit message:
     ```
     git commit -m "Initial commit: Adding QGIS project files"
     ```

7. **Link to GitHub Repository**:
   - On your GitHub repository page, copy the HTTPS or SSH URL provided (depending on your setup).
   - Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:
     ```
     git remote add origin <remote repository URL>
     ```

8. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Push your local repository to GitHub:
     ```
     git push -u origin master
     ```
   - If you have a main branch named differently (like `main`), replace `master` with your branch name.

9. **Verify on GitHub**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository page. You should see your QGIS project file and any associated data files listed.

### Notes:

- **File Size**: GitHub has a file size limit (currently 100 MB per file for free repositories). Ensure your QGIS project file and any large data files comply with this limit.
  
- **Ignore Unnecessary Files**: Create a `.gitignore` file in your repository to exclude unnecessary files (like temporary files, cached data, or large datasets that don't need versioning).

- **Collaboration**: GitHub facilitates collaboration by allowing multiple users to clone, modify, and contribute to the project. Use branches and pull requests for managing changes from different contributors.
